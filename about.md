I'm Ryan and Welcome to my website.  

###In Summary

Until recently I have pursued an academic path as I had no direct career in mind.  I studied Chemistry and Maths at UCL as I’ve always had a logical mindset and enjoyed the challenges these subjects presented up to A-level. With the benefit of hindsight this was a mistake and this has forced me to evaluate what I’m actually looking for in a career.  

After some time considering my options I started to teach myself to code through some online courses.  For the first time in a while I was excited to be working again, but these online courses weren’t enough, so I enrolled in the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course.  I am now excited to start to look for work as a junior developer.  

###My Interests

Outside of coding my interests lie in a wide range of activities.  Whilst at university I enjoyed playing table tennis both socially and competitively in a few tournaments. I also enjoyed playing squash and poker, in fact after setting up a poker society with a few friends we garnered enough steam and frequent players to restart the official poker society.  

Over the years whilst on summer break I would go out on a boat and took a RYA power boating course, to achieve my power boat license.  And in the winter I enjoy skiing regularly with whoever I can go with.  On the other end of the spectrum I do also enjoy gaming when I have the time, especially with friends.
