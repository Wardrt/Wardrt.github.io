This was my first project at GA.  I created a puzzle game the purpose of which is to navigate out of a car park.  You can play the game here : <a href="https://peaceful-woodland-17779.herokuapp.com/">https://peaceful-woodland-17779.herokuapp.com/</a>
I used JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML in the construction of the game.
