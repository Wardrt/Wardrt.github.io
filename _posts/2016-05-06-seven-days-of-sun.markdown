This was the group project I was involved in at GA that is used to find where the weather is sunny for the next 7 days.
Plan your next holiday here : <a href="http://sevendaysofsun.herokuapp.com/">http://sevendaysofsun.herokuapp.com/</a>
I used NodeJS, ExpressJS, AJAX, mongoose, bcrypt, passport, jwt, bootstrap, underscore, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, google maps API, Dark Sky API, sky scanner widget. I also learnt how to communicate with a team on a project and use Github with a team.
